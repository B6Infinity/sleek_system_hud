## Introduction
The **HUD Project** is a Python-based desktop application designed to provide a streamlined and efficient heads-up display (HUD) for monitoring system vitals such as CPU usage, RAM usage, and network activity. This project aims to enhance user experience by offering real-time data visualization in a lightweight and customizable interface.

## Features
- **Real-Time Updates**: Display live data with minimal latency.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Compatible with Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- **Lightweight and Fast**: Optimized for performance and low resource usage.
- **Customizable Appearance**: Modify fonts, colors, and layout.

## Installation
Follow these steps to set up the project:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/hud.git
    cd hud
    ```

2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

   Ensure you have Python 3.8+ installed on your system.

3. Run the application:
    ```bash
    python system_panel.py
    ```

## Usage
Once the application is running, a frameless HUD panel will appear on your desktop. The panel displays:
- **CPU Usage**: Real-time percentage of CPU utilization.
- **RAM Usage**: Real-time percentage of RAM utilization.
- **Network Activity**: Upload and download speeds in KB/s or MB/s.

You can drag the panel to reposition it or minimize it to the system tray. Right-click on the panel for additional options such as toggling "Always on Top" or exiting the application.
